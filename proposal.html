                    <li class="list_space">I will be using the Unsplash API to retrieve and share photos. I also plan 
                        to integrate Instagram's API for the social media/sharing aspect. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list_space" >
                        The API will get various sources of information and metadata about photos, a similar photos feature, and 
                        insight to an user about photos surrounding a topic or keywords of their choice.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list_space">The data I will collect from users would be only username's for the sharing aspect of the web app. I will
                        also collect data on different metrics like liked photos, number of photos shared, comments, and etc.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list_space">There are many data points in my database. There will be entities for a photos library for each user, 
                        each photo's metadata, comments entity, users table/entity for each user, liked photos table, authentication 
                        for users. </li>
